General Information
===================

This is a simple LaTeX plugin for Gedit.  The goal is to have a plugin
that creates a command to run LaTeX on the current Gedit document
and then use the SyncTeX plugin to open the pdf.

Goals
=====
In large part this is a learning exercise. It is also a result of me
being impatient for the gedit-latex plugin to get updated for Gnome3. I
also don't want quite as many features as the gedit-latex plugin
provides.  All I need is a clean interface and a keyboard short cut
that runs LaTeX.

Some future goals are to
* Create a config dialog that allows people to edit the TeX command.
* Simple log file parsing for errors.  Currently we just print the log
  file into the bottom panel.
* The current SyncTeX support is pretty raw.  It would be good to make
  sure that the plugin is installed and activated when this plugin is
  activated.

Installation
============

Simply copy simplelatex.py and simplatex.plugin to
~/.local/share/gedit/plugins .
