General Information
===================

This is a simple LaTeX plugin for Gedit.  The goal is to have a plugin
that creates a command to run LaTeX on the current Gedit document
and then use the SyncTeX plugin to open the pdf.

Goals
-----
In large part this is a learning exercise. It is also a result of me
being impatient for the gedit-latex plugin to get updated for Gnome3. I
also don't want quite as many features as the gedit-latex plugin
provides.  All I need is a clean interface and a keyboard short cut
that runs LaTeX.

Some future goals are to
* The current SyncTeX support is pretty raw.  It would be good to make
  sure that the plugin is installed and activated when this plugin is
  activated.
* Create a true install script.

Current Features
----------------
* Compile the current tex document using `<Ctrl>t`
* Auto-open the pdf when a tex document is open
* Auto-close the pdf when the tex document is closed
* Run Bibtex and MakeIndex on the current file

Dependencies 
============
* Rubber - https://launchpad.net/rubber - this allows us to easily process the tex log file.
